OPEN SOURCE PCB files for -Versatile quadrature antenna for precise control of large electron spin ensembles in Diamond-

18-01-2024


The Zip file contains the KiCad project and the resultant Gerber files printed to reproduce the cuadrature MW patch antenna. 
The PCB consists of a panel of 4 different antennas, 2 of them for a diamond of size 2x2 mm and the other two for a diamond of 3x3 mm. 
There are antennas with and without pads to solder the capacitors.

Depending on availability, we may have spare printed PCBs to share. Please, feel welcome to enquire about PCB antennas available or other information.
